=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides a method that calculates Doug Drinen's simple ranking system. 
It also provides access to some other useful team and season stats.

    use Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking;
    my $stats = Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking->new();
    my $games = [
        "Boston,13,Atlanta, 27",
        "Dallas,17,Chicago,21",
        "Eugene,30,Fairbanks,41",
        "Atlanta,15,Chicago,3",
        "Eugene,21,Boston,24",
        "Fairbanks,17,Dallas,7",
        "Dallas,19,Atlanta,7",
        "Boston,9,Fairbanks,31",
        "Chicago,10,Eugene,30",
    ];
    $stats->load_data( $games );
    my  $srs = $stats->simpleranking( verbose => 1 );
    my $mov = $stats->mov;
    my $sos = $stats->sos;
    for ( keys %$srs ) {
        print "Team $_ has a srs of ", $srs->{$_};
        print " and a mov of ",$mov->{$_},"\n";
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The simple ranking system is one based on rates of scoring, generally by starting with team margin of victory (i.e. average point spread). It is perhaps the simplest model of the form

 Team Strength = a x (Mov) + b x (Opponent Strength)

In the simple ranking system, a = 1 and b = 1/(number of opponents played). Matrix solutions of this linear equation tend to be very unstable, whereas an iterative solution rapidly converges to a stable answer. This object implements the iterative solution, and since doing that much work means the object can calculate a number of other useful values on the data set, it does so as well.

One more note, though commonly described as N equations in N unknowns, an additional constraint is required to solve to a single unique answer, and that is that the sum of all simple rankings must add up to 0.0. This also guarantees that the average club in a season has a ranking of zero.

=head3 pythag()

The Pythagorean formula is a rule of thumb that estimates winning percentage from points scored and points allowed. 

 Estimated Winning Percentage = (Pts Scored)**N/( (Pts Scored)**N + (Pts Allowed)**N )

In the original Bill James formulation, the power of the Pythagorean formula, N, is 2. This implementation can calculate the
Pythagorean power from the game data set itself.


 my $teams = $stats->team_stats();
 my $predicted = $stats->pythag();
 for (sort keys %$teams) {
     printf "%s:  %6.2f %6.2f\n", $_, $team{$_}{win_pct}, $predicted{$_};
 }

Input:  If none given, will assume N = 2. 

 my $predicted = $stats->pythag();

If input is a number, that number will be used to calculate the power of the Pythagorean prediction.

 my $predicted = $stats->pythag(2.5);

If input is a reference to a scalar, and the option 'best => 1' is used, then this program will use a golden mean search to find the best fit value of N, and return the value in the reference provided.

 my $predicted = $stats->pythag( \$exp, best => 1 );

Output: 

A hash reference with team names as keys and predicted winning percentage as values.

This function will return an empty hash reference if data have not yet been loaded.

=head3 sos()

Strength of schedule is the sum of the simple rankings of all teams that
played a specific team, divided by the total number of teams that played
the team.

 my $sos = $stats->sos();
 for (sort keys %$sos) {
     printf "team %s: strength of schedule: %6.2f\n", $_, $sos{$_};

Input: none required

Output: a hash of sos values (strength of schedule) per team.

=head3 simpleranking()

Input: none required, options possible.

Example:

 my $mov = $stats->mov();
 my $sos = $stats->sos();

     printf " + strength of schedule: %6.2f\n",$sos{$_};
 }

Options:

    epsilon => value

    This is a convergence criterion. Usually you won't need to set this.

    maxiter => value

    A stopgap to prevent runaways. Usually unnecessary as this algorithm converges rapidly.

    verbose => value

    Set this on to visually watch values converge.

Output: The simple rankings of the data as a hash of values per team name.

=head2 DATA LOADING

There are  two methods provided, C<load_data()> and C<add_data()>. The method
C<load_data()> can only be used once, then C<add_data()> thereafter. 

=head3 load_data()

Input: a reference to an array of comma separated strings of the form:

"visting team,score,home team,score"

Example:

    use Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking;
    my $stats = Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking->new();
    my $games = [
        "Boston,13,Atlanta, 27",
        "Dallas,17,Chicago,21",
        "Eugene,30,Fairbanks,41",
        "Atlanta,15,Chicago,3",
        "Eugene,21,Boston,24",
        "Fairbanks,17,Dallas,7",

        "Boston,9,Fairbanks,31",
        "Chicago,10,Eugene,30",
    ];
    $stats->load_data( $games );

This calculation requires at least two teams, and then at least two games per
team in order to be successful.

Output: returns 1 on success, croaks on failure.

=head3 add_data()

Input: a reference to an array of comma separated strings of the form:

"visting team,score,home team,score"

Example:

    use Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking;
    my $stats = Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking->new();
    # first two weeks games.
    my $games = [
        "Boston,13,Atlanta, 27",
        "Dallas,17,Chicago,21",
        "Eugene,30,Fairbanks,41",
        "Atlanta,15,Chicago,3",
        "Eugene,21,Boston,24",
        "Fairbanks,17,Dallas,7",
    ];
    $stats->load_data( $games );
    # add another week of games.
    my $newgames = [
        "Dallas,19,Atlanta,7",
        "Boston,9,Fairbanks,31",
        "Chicago,10,Eugene,30",
    ];
    $stats->add_data( $newgames ); 

This calculation requires at least two teams, and then at least two games per
team in order to be successful.

Output: returns 1 on success, croaks on failure.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 accessors and calculations
 
 No data are loaded presently.

Data need to be loaded before this value can be returned.

 No data are calculated presently.

Data need to be loaded and simpleranking needs to be run first.

=head2 load_data()

 You can only load data once into this object. Use add_data to add more data.

Code attempts to use load_data more than once. Use add_data instead.

 Method load_data requires a reference to a games array.

Either no data passed to load_data, or the wrong kind of data has been passed to load_data.
Arrays should be dereferenced: C<\@array>.

 The home score is undefined in array element X. Perhaps you have missed a comma?

This happens when there are less than 3 commas in a data string passed to the method. 

 The visitor score field in array element X needs to be a number.

The second field in a game string needs to be a number.

 The home score field in array element X needs to be a number.

The fourth field in a game string needs to be a number.

 Method load_data requires at least two games to analyze data.
 Method load_data requires at least two teams.
 Method load_data requires at least as many games as teams.
 Method load_data requires team T to have played at least two games.

There are certain minimum data requirements for this program to function.

 The number of teams in this data set is exceptionally large.

Happens if you pass more than 1000 teams to this method.

 The number of games in this data set is exceptionally large.
 
Happens if you pass more than 1,000,000 games to this method.


=head2 add_data()

 Method add_data requires a reference to a games array.

automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

The algorithm requires at least two teams, and at least two games per team to calculate a simple ranking. If you have N teams, a minimum of N games are required in order to do the simple ranking calculation. It could be more, depending on who has played whom.
